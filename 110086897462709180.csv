How is he going to win in 2024 with less support and same fraudulent activities within our elections? He hasn’t committed any crimes to be arrested. I’m voting for Robert Kennedy Junior. Fuck Trump.

The one thing that bothers me just a little, is when you point out the fake news.  I think you should ""endorse"" or acknowledge the ones who are not fake,  as they have been to all your rallies,  not afraid to show the crowd,  and praise them a bit,  no? Like RSB is always there and don't fall into the fake news category.  They should be praised.",110088023419215598
