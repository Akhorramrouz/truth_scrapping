94,Mar 26,ToddShipes,"Todd Shipes@ToddShipes·Mar 26Replying to @realDonaldTrumpThe fact that these people even “think” DeSantis has a chance to beat President Trump in the GOP race, tells me two things:1. DeSanctimonious’ aides are low IQ individuals and do not yet realize the catastrophic hit they took in the polls last week. And…2. Ron himself is politically incompetent and doesn’t understand that branding himself as part of the swamp is political suicide.Could this all be bait by Trump? Or is RDS a ?  but either way RDS now has ZERO chance of beating the GOAT !12",110091267469894623
