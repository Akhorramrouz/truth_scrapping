DeSantis has a lot of time in his career, and what we need is a unified front to bring in as many votes as possible, not to splinter what we have. Gov. DeSantis is clearly the candidate of the future, President Trump is the candidate for NOW.  They should spend as much time as possible cementing their COMMON policy views and leave their differences at the door!",110085141271840216
