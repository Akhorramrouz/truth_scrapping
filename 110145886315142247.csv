85,1d,cooperbestdog,"honesty@cooperbestdog·1dReplying to @Lara45First of all trump is a disgraced EX president. President Biden didn’t pay hush money to a porn star. President Biden didn’t call state election and attempt to pressure them to find votes for him. That’s election interference. President didn’t attempt a coup, that resulted in injury,death, and destruction of government property, in attempt to overthrow a free and fair election.  President didn’t   obstruct the retrieval of taken classified government property.  What should President get indicte?3",110146878363272208

I am sure more people feel sorry for him and not see how much damage is being done. We need to be strong though and set him aside letting him know it’s okay we’ll take it from here 3,110146146384256945
