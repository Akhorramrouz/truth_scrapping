Why aren't any people putting pressure on these paid off maggots ruining America. We don't post phone numbers we don't post names we don't post anything that puts them in the limelight other than a dumbass article. That's doing nothing to get political prisoners out of jail. Nancy are you too scared to walk down the street? Can't wait to rip your pictures down from the halls of the capital12,110099119384304347

It's unlikely that you or J6 singers' songs would get more plays than hers. Also, Sir, you are not really a musician and haven't put out any real songs, just appeared in some music videos and spoken word performances. Sorry, Sir.#MAGA#ettd",110099176141780653
