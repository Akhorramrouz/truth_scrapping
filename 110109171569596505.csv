A Republican who refuses to say that 2020 was an election full of problems and deficiencies which clearly benefited one side should NEVER EVER get any support from conservatives unless he or she is running for office in a very DEEP blue state or district. If DeSantis refuses to say that 2020 was unfair even from a state where he won by close to 20, he will definitely be a fraud on a national level.2436108",110109196982674864

Has Sean always been this arrogant and flip? He seems worse than ever.I have not watched him in months and it pained me to have to turn on his show to be able to see you there. I bet his ratings went up with you there.We love you and it's obvious to all of us that Fox News, including Tucker and Sean and Laura, are working against you. We don't like it.17",110109987231334182

You keep trying to look better than you were.  The intelligent people out there need explanations on things like Warp Speed and other absurd things you were either duped into or you were part of the problem like Lock-Downs.  Things no liberty minded person would ever back.We deserve answers if you want our support!  Stop focusing on others, focus on you!  Explain it!",110109989867780807
