He sacrificed everything to stand in the way for us, investigated and under constant Media slander for seven years. Today he faced one of the most crucial moments we can ever imagine, only because he’s working for us the people, but he handled it braver than anyone ever could do. It should have never happened in free County like America. It should be a warning shot, a eye opener for everyone. We can’t allow this to be our new normal!1441163",110143629332330087

When they're giving away their money to other countries and for ppl to not work? Democrats who have blown all our $ and bailed out failing banks?51",110149532051317460
