He is not beholding to Bush, Rove, Romney and McCain”s ghost. Plant those seeds of dissent. They will germinate. People want a sure thing with a record. They are wary of Swamp ties. DeSantis should be treated as though he is a Bush. Ron may be a good governor and far better than Jeb Bush who was just ok but would anyone want Jeb Bush as President? Ron did well because 800,000 new voters invaded Florida to escape northern tyranny.",110100383429512162
