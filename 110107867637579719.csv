I have lots money to his campaign, went to rally’s, voted for him twice, etc. I’m very concerned about his judgement & not sure he is who we need. He admitted to being influenced to appoint people like; Wray, Powell, Barr, Chow, etc. These people are the swamp. They have rained havoc on the country & American people & mostly on Trump himself. If we elect him again, we expect more appointments that feed his ego instead of fixing the country. I’m afraid so!2",110107931724433213
