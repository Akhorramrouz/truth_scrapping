Democrats are the toxic ones and they are terrified of Trump. No person in the entire history of this country has ever faced such unending persecution. Every single thing they have accused him of has eventually been found to be false.... and yet they keep making things up and people like you fall for it.You are looking through the eyes of the left-stream media and not thinking for yourself.2",110132210562107584

Trump endorsed Tim Michels cuz if his stolen election pledge over Rebecca kleifisch.  Michels barely won the primary and was against a weak dem Gov and got  beat cuz he was a horrible candidate.  Our elections are fine.  toxic trump hand chose a horrible candidate - just like he did in 4 other senate purple states.

You really expect someone who has been framed for one thing after another, accused of one thing after another, then watch those who committed those crimes against him walk of scot-free and not say anything.YOU have a terrible ego, and a mind incapable of rational thought. Trump always puts Jesus first, never himself, but like every Democrat, you just have to take things out of context and flat out lie.1",110155114633664714

But this is about the future and the future means he can’t win the purple states he won in 16 - period.  Look at his losing track record in 22 with purple states.  He has left a trail of destruction by forcing candidates to take the stolen election pledge.  I have an ego ?
