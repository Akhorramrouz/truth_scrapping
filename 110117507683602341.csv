118,Mar 31,IdeasMatter,"Ideas Matter@IdeasMatter·Mar 31Replying to @ZephaniahMazzaroth and @realDonaldTrumpan interesting point if I understand it. You’re pointing out that church leaders did not stand up when the 10 Commandments for being removed from court houses and schools and prayer was being banned from schools. And you’re saying it is because they did not want to lose their tax exempt status. That’s a strong point. I also, they claimed that Jesus was not political. But in fact, he has been given all authority over earth (Matt 28:18). That very much includes politics. ￼212",110118444096493554
