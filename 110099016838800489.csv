95,Mar 28,michaelleprophet,"Michael Le Prophet@michaelleprophet·Mar 28Replying to @realDonaldTrumpThe seven-year tribulation period coincides with seven years of war. In April 2022 CE, a war began in heaven and will end in October 2025. Revelation 12:7-9 Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought, but they did not prevail, nor was there a place in heaven any longer. Revelation Chapter 12 In October 2025 CE, Satan, and his angels are cast to the earth, instigating WWIII. In April 2029, our Lord returns to end the war.",110099036849691153

None of them had guns, but the fake news will tell you five officers died. I’m so sick of them fellow Americans we need to take back our country and see that we are being lied to we, the people elect the federal government not the other way around. We are not their SERFS nor CHATTEL.  As long as the CCP has the software 50 states and voting machines we will never see another true election.",110099040123388678
