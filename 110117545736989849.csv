And this time, u unlike his 2 impeachments, the jury won't be full of his cult members.. 1",110118263037899193
92,Mar 31,JeremyLClark,JeremyLClark@JeremyLClark·Mar 31Replying to @Trumpwon2ndplace and @AleathaThis indictment’s a joke. Everyone knows it just as we all knew the impeachment was a joke. Even if he were to be prosecuted for this his base will not care. The thing is dems have been dirty for so long their base has just been letting it go on account of wanting their policies over conservatives. They were always able to count on conservatives of the opposite whenever one of our candidates had some filth from their past though. Not anymore we’re fed up and will back Trump regardless.1,110119372166342457
93,Mar 31,Trumpwon2ndplace,Trumpwon2ndplace@Trumpwon2ndplace·Mar 31Replying to @JeremyLClarkOf course you won't care if your cult leader is convicted.. You're in a cult.. You also would not care if he shot someone on 5th Ave.. It's going to be hilarious when he loses in 2024 by 10 million votes.. You will blame his multiple convictions while at the same time claiming that he has more support... And even some of his cult will win Darwin awards because of it...(like ashli babbitt) It's going to be awesome!And none of us will care that you called this indictment a joke.. 1,110119470430898556

95,Mar 31,Trumpwon2ndplace,Trumpwon2ndplace@Trumpwon2ndplace·Mar 31Replying to @SamJackson1001Well his cult will believe anything and back his criminal activities.. The dems aren't in a cult.. So doesn't matter who you blame for the division..1,110119505569056866
96,Apr 1,SamJackson1001,SamJackson1001@SamJackson1001·Apr 1Replying to @Trumpwon2ndplaceThe Dems are literally a cult. They believe in chaos and disorder. They would rather have morals that change on the fly to fit their never ending and never achieving goal of Utopia. Their ultimate demise will always be some sort of tyranny because they will sacrifice what is good to achieve what they cannot acquire. The goal posts forever change and will never be satisfied.1,110122329623295332
