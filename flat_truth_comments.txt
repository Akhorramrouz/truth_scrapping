Meaning you probably missed some if not all of it.In 2018 while Trump was still Pres his justice department under Barr proved this action ($ to S. Daniels under the table & repayment of monies given as "legal expenses" violated the law).  The defendant was Micheal Cohen (Trump's lawyer).So yes.  It IS a crime and has been proven to be a crime by Trump's own justice dept.Then Trump pardoned Cohen.Because of course he did...23

That’s the division perpetrated upon us to assure the “correct” candidate wins and we cheer on our favorites like at at sporting event. This voter fraud has been going on forever…all the way down to the local level. Trump has finally allowed many of us to see it. He is their antithesis.

Steve@neofighter·Apr 2Replying to @SJT_MAGA, @MAGAPaTrIomega, and 3 moreYour assessment is 100% correct. In 2016 the people voted him into office. But he had help. That story is way out there and has to do with a physical threat consisting of this: If the true vote was not allowed to pass through the voting fraud machines…very bad things were going to happen to the perpetrators right then on the evening of the vote. That’s why everyone in the media was in shock. He won bigger the 2nd time. But the good guys allowed the steal to happen. WHY? So we all could see it.114

Not perfect… but egalitarian society. The elites could not have that because it lacked the one major component of their putrid existence. CONTROL. Since that time they engineered society to make us dependent and weak. We are in the process of shaking off that slumber. Unfortunately…most of us have to be shown and not told.12

JB MacKay@gordocaballero·Apr 1Replying to @Lazer9192 and @Tr0naldumpThe stealing of elections has been going on for years.

The DS was counting on the fact that no one would call out the first black president. And almost no one did. I was just never sure how they pulled it off. But they just kept getting more and more blatant/arrogant until they stepped in with this latest escapade. Now things are much clearer.23

Kiki@menzachick·8hReplying to @Shushthu, @_ero, and 9 moreSo apparently you’re a hot mess who can’t distinguish an incompetent President from one who cared about America and it’s citizens?   And…..I’m not a Republican.  Just an intelligent researcher who isn’t fooled by lies and BS this current administration is feeding you.   Do you go grocery shopping?   Have a car you need to fill up?   Children or grandchildren in a Blue state, etc.  and if you still think Biden isn’t a failure, then YOU are.

Or even just a comma?And "God" is a proper noun in this case, so by not capitalizing the "g" you're disrespecting Him.Go and get a better education. Do something that improves how everyone else sees your side. People can't take you seriously or sincerely if they're laughing at you.

Dubonnet@Dubonnet·4dReplying to @Albertabuck and @DubonnetHousing market is strong, a sane person who works across the aisle is in charge of our government, the NATO alliance is experiencing a strong resurgence, the White House staff is stable and relatively drama free, Covid has been handled, diabetics pay less for insulin, I have excellent, affordable health insurance, the wealthy are starting to pay their fair share of taxes and lots of clean energy and infrastructure jobs are appearing on the horizon. No more stupid scandals to worry about. The end21
 
 
 
 
Albertabuck@Albertabuck·3dReplying to @DubonnetWho is this sane person you speak of? Nato is a joke that should have been defunded and dismantled decades ago. The Whitehouse is filled with diversity hires with zero experience. Any extra taxes pushed on the wealthy will be passed on to consumers ie.you. The Biden administration has been one scandal after another. What else you got, anything factual?21
 
 
 
 
Dubonnet@Dubonnet·3dReplying to @Albertabuck and @DubonnetYou said you had one question.  Well my friend it’s been answered.

eric@thebunkef·3dReplying to @wenken24, @Albertabuck, and 1 moreTechnically the term “disbanded” was never utilized. When was the last time the need for such a court was needed. That’s what it was founded to be. A simple court to insure war criminals were handled. What have they done since the Nuremberg trials. Who talked to them and said America shouldn’t be paying everyones’ bills here, your country should pay their own bills and we’re expecting each of you socialist countries to do just that.Putin asked NATO to assist they told him to handle it.37

Mr. R E Wamsley@littleshaver·4dReplying to @freedomfightergirlks, @ck2021, and 10 moreHave you watched the news in the last 2 years at all? You hate the one guy who is standing up for the country you love? He doesn’t even need the job. He could leave this country and move anywhere he wants and watch the world crumble. Come on now. Trump is not the smooth talker that we hoped for and he doesn’t have a halo or angel wings but he is the guy to fix this country. He’s done it once already. Sorry to say but you might want to take a long look at who is brain washed. 11

Michael Le Prophet@michaelleprophet·2dReplying to @Lindlerof5 and @Gopher4MnDonald J. Trump's victory in the 2020 CE election was stolen to fulfill God's purpose. President Trump will become the 47th and last President of the U.S.A. and will serve three terms leading Americans through World War III from October 2025 CE - April 2029 CE. The Russians and Chinese prepare for war while the Biden administration drains our national petroleum reserve and wealth and demoralizes our military. President Trump will have ten months to prepare for World War III upon taking office.3
 
 
 
 
Gopher4Mn@Gopher4Mn·2dReplying to @Lindlerof5 and @Gopher4MnTrump was the guy that made me a Republican.  I went door knocking for him in a very blue state both times and it was brutal.  Sadly #65% of the country is so brainwashed against him, we’re going to end up with Biden again.  This country cannot survive another 4 years of Dem.  Just look at the polls-60% agree he should be indicted, incl 65% of Independents, even though a majority think it’s politically motivated. Do you think that 65% would ever vote for Trump and we can’t win without them.1

And are used for propaganda, thinking people see these results so are happy they are voting the same or could change minds to vote that way. So, I take no trust in any polls. Some will give an answer also because it is popular in that area and they dont want to seem like someone different. I've heard people say they go to an indoor small rally because there is free food there, and not of that party.2

The mere fact that he is even thinking about running for president during his term as governor says he has zero commitment to anything he promises, specifically to those who voted for him as governor. By extension, that would be anyone voting for him as president.

CLEAN UP THE MESS AGAIN!!!!!@RandoLouisiana·3dReplying to @realDonaldTrumpThank you Mr President. Americans need to unite against enemies foreign and domestic. It is unfortunate many are too stupid to understand what is going to happen to them. The useless, weak and unproductive will not be coddled and appeased like what is going on now. They will be summarily shot or put into slavery if communist ever gain control of our Country. All Americans should identify as Americans (nothing else) and should be indoctrinated that this Country is the last best chance for freedom

Context is not over rated.                           Small minds are a disservice to America. I would hate to have to label you that based on your comments here alone.

You MAGA cultist have no limits to the mental gymnastics you will throw your self through in order to escape having to confront the massive hypocrisy your cult leader spews. I don’t even like JB but if you want to look for behavior of a dictator maybe you should look at the guy who is calling for the constitution to be eliminated.1

Tim Collins@itwasntriggedyoujustlost·3dReplying to @Vernamay, @Duphorn, and 4 moreAnd what do you want the military to do exactly? How American would it be for the military to somehow get into the business of picking political sides vs defending the country as a whole. It seems like you have a shaky understanding of how the US works but the military defends the citizens of the country and their rights. Not just those they agree with politically.2
 
 
 
 
Verna@Vernamay·2dReplying to @itwasntriggedyoujustlost, @Duphorn, and 5 moreIt should of already been done when Biden invaded our Southern Boarders with illegals and drug cartel’s. Don’t get me started as to” how American it would be.”  It’s certainly NOT American to do the things this whole Administration and the leftist that follows them have been doing ever since they stole their way into the White House.

Russ1973c@Russ1973c·2dReplying to @81ConservativeWho himself was also a slave, but I don't understand, what's your point?1
 
 
 
 
81Conservative@81Conservative·2dReplying to @Russ1973cThat's my point. Kinda hard to blame "whitey" when Africans sold Africans TO Africans but sure... "White racism"11
 
 
 
 
Russ1973c@Russ1973c·2dReplying to @81ConservativeI think you'll lose that fight. I think the majority of slave owners were white. Since he was a slave it probably wasn't his idea originally.

Royster@clowntruck·3dReplying to @realDonaldTrumpDeSantis is a smart man and will be President one day. A washed up democrat strategist dork doesn’t have a clue about what’s going on. Waiting in the wings while Trump slings and dodges shit bombs is a wise strategy at this point of the game. Trump is afraid of him right now and DeSantis hasn’t even decided to get serious yet. Trump may fall into Bragg’s pile of crap and come out smelling like a rose or not. Ron is letting the cards play out like a seasoned pro.

Let the corrupt bullies of the Democrat party fall on their swords. Historic corruption on full display for the world to see. And they do! You will prevail, no weapon formed against you will prosper. You are the Lion, they are the sheep. May the bright light of the truth preside over the arraignment so blinding that those who are of evil intentions be illuminated and exposed as the criminals they are.

Searching4Truth@LiesTold·2dReplying to @marymcgarrI don’t think I’ve ever donated to anyone’s political campaign. Both parties are very well financially supported by lobbyists, pharma corporates, unions, PACs, etc… I wouldn’t be surprised if candidates used donated $$$$ for sex and hush $$$.. the one with most $$$$ wins. Probably so many great candidates out there with not enough backing to get his word out.
 
 
 
 
RayRayZee@RayRayZee·1dReplying to @JoedsavageDid you happen to watch T***p arrive at the NYC Courthouse and when he walked from the booking room into the courtroom? He looks like he's going to cry. And we just learned that Criminal Defendant T***p has been charged with 34 felony counts. Life as he knows it is all but over for this pussy-assed wimp. Margie Spork-Foot even showed up to spew her hate. Within 3 minutes, New Yorkers shouted her down and gave her the bum's rush out of town. With T***p's indictment, America can begin to heal.1
 
 
 
 
RayRayZee@RayRayZee·1dReplying to @JoedsavageCriminal Defendant T***p... It has a nice ring to it, don't you think? Perchance, are you on the verge of a mental breakdown? Criminal Defendant T***p was charged with 34 felonies. He's in some deep doo-doo. And all you naysayers said that T***p would never be indicted.11
 
 
 
 
RayRayZee@RayRayZee·1dReplying to @JoedsavageNow that T***p is a criminal defendant, I wouldn't be surprised if a Peoples' Temple Jonestown-style event happens among MAGAt's.1
 
 
 
 
Joedsavage@Joedsavage·1dReplying to @RayRayZeeLOL!!    The MUZZY BITCH still whacking off.  Koran. Ass cheeks. Tall building.  LOL!!1
 
 
 
 
RayRayZee@RayRayZee·1dReplying to @JoedsavageCriminal defendant T***p just ran out of the courtroom into the hallway. Didn't stop to speak with reporters. He looks like he was crying. He looks like he's a beaten down and broken little man-child. His criminal indictment is even more humiliating than his huge electoral loss to Joe Biden. This is a great day for America. The greatest criminal in US history is being brought to justice. Oh, there was no indication that he pooped his pants in court.1
 
 
 
 
Joedsavage@Joedsavage·1dReplying to @RayRayZeeBlah blah blah.  The worshipper of a pedophile is hilarious.  Koran. Ass cheeks. Tall building. Do it MUZZY.1
 
 
 
 
RayRayZee@RayRayZee·1dReplying to @JoedsavageYou're really freaking out, dude. It's not all that bad. It's just a career criminal who has been brought to justice. And you naysayers always said that criminal defendant T***p would never be indicted.2

RayRayZee@RayRayZee·1dReplying to @JoedsavageOh yeah, you're having a mental breakdown. After all, your cult leader was just indicted on 34 felony counts. No matter how much hateful insults that you spew, T***p will forever be known as a criminal defendant or a convicted felon.11
 
 
 
 
Joedsavage@Joedsavage·1dReplying to @RayRayZeeNope. But all you communist trash will be turned in to pavement stains AKMED.

RayRayZee@RayRayZee·1dReplying to @JoedsavageI don't have any problems, but do you know who does? Criminal Defendant T***p. He has a whole slew of problems. Life as he knows it is over.11

RayRayZee@RayRayZee·1dReplying to @JoedsavageI suspect that beginning this evening, we will begin to see MAGAt's jumping out of buildings or holding poisoned Kool-Aid parties. The indictment even mentions one of his out-of-wedlock children, not his and Ivanka's son, Barron.1

RayRayZee@RayRayZee·1dReplying to @Joedsavage and @AlfenhiemerBack from frying chicken MAGAt. Did you notice how NYPD showed contempt for criminal defendant T***p? They wouldn't even give him the courtesy of holding the door open for him. He was treated like any other criminal at arraignment. Today is a great day in America! People around the world are cheering T***p's arrent.
 
 
 
 
Joedsavage@Joedsavage·1dReplying to @RayRayZee and @AlfenhiemerWhat's the matter AKMED?? Choke on chicken bones??   Where's your little horse shit taunts?? Come on you goat fucking bitch I'm waiting.1
 
 
 
 
RayRayZee@RayRayZee·1dReplying to @Joedsavage and @AlfenhiemerJust finished my fried chicken and French fries. The same kind of French fries that criminal defendant T***p slathers with ketchup before throwing them against the wall. Today an appeals court ruled against criminal defendant T***p and his former COS Mark Meadows and Mike Pence have to testify before Special Counsel Jack Smith's grand jury. Criminal defendant T***p is screwed royally. This makes me happy.2
 
 
 
 
RayRayZee@RayRayZee·1dReplying to @JoedsavageT***p lashes out at those who confront him with facts the same way that you are. With profane insults. I don't have to go get 'em. DA Alvin Bragg got him.1

RayRayZee@RayRayZee·1dReplying to @JoedsavageReporters who were in the courtroom said that when asked for his plea, criminal defendant T***p whimpered a weak "not guilty." Now his motorcade is caught up in a traffic jam on the BQE.1

He’s made his whole life as a business man with both ups and downs. Yet, he didn’t quit and that’s what makes a good business man. He is a man full of faults but whose recognized and given his heart to Jesus. Something most people don’t seem to understand. We all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus” God is love13

TrumpTrain2024@ddecapita·1dReplying to @outoftit, @BooMo, and 6 moreYou are absolutely right about mental health. That is what is killing kids in schools. The moral decay in society is a direct result of the radical left’s inability to accept reality(a man is a man and a woman is a woman)and the corruption of our youth (kiddie drag shows). Outrageous and disgusting.13
 
 
 
 
outoftit@outoftit·6hReplying to @ddecapita, @BooMo, and 6 moreEven scarier beyond the pretend culture wars that Trump energises his base with (it's bollox, and not common) is the fact that he sews division and conflict (for his own gain) in a country where there are more guns than people >> if this division continues,  the blood bath will be hell like (you all have guns) and Trump will be a major cause of it. He's evil, a devil and you need a peacekeeper like Our Lord, Jesus Christ.

Mizzer@1965mizzer·2dReplying to @Herefortheshitshow33I'm going to proudly wear it in his support!  It will show the travesty. Just like this indictment,  it will bite the democrats in the butt!  It will fuel the patriotism and ignite Trump support! This just made sure 45 will be 47!! I know many that never voted for him that will definitely vote for him now.  You all just shot yourself in the foot!  The majority can see the Banana Republic tactics.  Not in our AMERICA!!314
 
 
 
 
Herefortheshitshow33@Herefortheshitshow33·2dReplying to @1965mizzerIf you say holding someone accountable for their actions is wrong then wtf are laws for?  There isn’t a majority…4
 
 
 
 
Mizzer@1965mizzer·2dReplying to @Herefortheshitshow33Are you kidding! this at most is a misdemeanor.  Manipulating law to  Indite a political opponent is a Banana Republic move. What about the Clinton's, do you know how many woman Bill payed off. It's not illegal to pay someone hush money.Then they had enough on Hillary to put her away, but because of her position decided not to indict. Then let's talk documents! Biden has documents he's refusing to hand over. He was VP and never had the right to have these in his possession.14
 
 
 
 
Mizzer@1965mizzer·2dReplying to @Herefortheshitshow33So exactly!  Wtf are laws for if we can't rely on them. It's a scary day when those that don't agree with your ideals can manipulate laws so they can get an indictment.  Stalin said, "show me the man and I'll find the crime". That's exactly what they are doing! 11 million documents investigated and this is what they've got, lol.  I wonder what we'd find in 11 mil docs of Bidens, Clinton's, Obama's. Wake up, this is an attack! Braggs should be in jail for this!!15
 
 
 
 
Mizzer@1965mizzer·2dReplying to @Herefortheshitshow33Btw, poll after poll (even liberal) is showing the "majority" feel this indictment is political!  People do see this as a Banana Republic move! And It definitely has increased Trumps base. 7 mil in 3 days. Another million donated yesterday.  The majority from people that had never donated before. Even people that don't like Trump can still see the travesty.  If we don't change our countries projectory we will be a communist country. The democrats have us on the fast train to just that!14

Joe Biden has done nothing positive for the American people but wasted our resources. The Biden Administration's goal is to corrupt and destroy everything good that America stands for. Joe Biden hates God and cannot even call Him by His name, and instead refers to God as "that thing." The Obama and Biden Administrations are responsible for causing World War III in October 2025 CE.

President Trump will become the 47th and last President of the U.S.A. and will serve three terms leading Americans through World War III from October 2025 CE - April 2029 CE. The Russians and Chinese prepare for war while the Biden administration drains our national petroleum reserve and wealth and demoralizes our military. President Trump will have ten months to prepare for World War III upon taking office.4

Oh, also, the reason I seem to repeat a lot of things that other liberals talk about is the same reason you hear a lot of people talking about how the sky is blue and grass is green. I don’t watch TV or legacy media, I get my info from all the independent sources you guys seem to love and hate simultaneously. <31
 
 
 
 
Larry Hart@williams62·2dReplying to @JackOnTheInterweb, @Arrmann, and 5 more￼ Why couldn’t you’ve given us an explanation two days ago? It would’ve been a lot easier for all of us.  I said jack off because your name is Jack on. But I wasn’t even talking to you. I￼￼￼ wasn’t trying to get under your skin, just looking for an explanation. If you want me to get under your skin, I can accommodate you ? Repeating yourself over and over again ￼ without explanation ￼is what liberals do. I do appreciate the explanation. ￼  “You guys”???1

But what you give us is made up, false, unverified, or dead-end information. It is you who who is unwilling to accept the truth. The media, large corporations, some Republicans known as rinos, and most of the democrats belong to a criminal syndicate, otherwise known as WEF Klaus Schwab and others. You are a fool.

Trump knew what it would take for a man to become a great President & leader in our nation!  So glad that he decided to run and WON…TWICE!  When the truth comes out & he’s back in office (officially, that is…we know he’s CIC!) it will be one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of our beloved USA!

QED: Next Indictment Pls@Gbyj·2dReplying to @Lara45Cos little miss mega-maga-lie is reknowned outside the magat-minions as being the voice of all things sensible & true. NOT!MAGAts are going to cry to the court case, verdic & beyond. Its what they do. Lets not forget they are STILL crying about the 2020 election being 'stolen'!They cry, rest of the world laugh, but AT the USA, not with USA.Lying, threatening, juvenile name calling, belittling the families of DAs, Grand Juries & Judges really aren't needed if you know you're innocent22
 
 
 
 
Cindy Marquez@cynthialopez77·2dReplying to @Gbyj and @Lara45On the contrary.  MAGA is extremely content that we know for a fact that 2020 was a FRAUDULENT ELECTION.  We’re not crying but we are ensuring that we don’t let the corrupt left do it again!. All the other attempts the left is trying to take down Trump will also FAIL.  So us MAGA were content with that as well.  2

QED: Next Indictment Pls@Gbyj·2dReplying to @grammabearJan 6th was very real. I saw it live, unedited, with all the bad bits in & it was real. 2020 election wasn't stolen. It was either won by Dems or lost by Republicans, depending on your viewpoint, but the end result was that Biden became President.As for Jack Smiths Grand Jury, if Trump had surrendered the documents when REPEATEDLY asked for them, and hadn't lied & claim he didn't have them, an arranged FBI visit, with warrant, wouldn't have been necessary.So, thats the TRUTH22

ChallengerGirl2011@ChallengerGirl2011·1dReplying to @DonaldkeepsLosingLOL and @Huskergal64I find it funny, that they all claim to be Christian, more like hypocrites.

ChallengerGirl2011@ChallengerGirl2011·1dReplying to @DonaldkeepsLosingLOL and @Huskergal64I grew up in the Catholic church and saw at a young age, just how sick and twisted they were, not to mention a bunch of hypocrites.21

ChallengerGirl2011@ChallengerGirl2011·1dReplying to @DonaldkeepsLosingLOL and @Huskergal64I hated going to church, but it was the only way I could go to the stables. I hated catechism, tried to get kicked out, but to no avail. My Mom was a devout Catholic, I wanted so bad to tell her what I saw, but she didnt or didnt want to see it. I let it go. I also havent been in a church in over 45 years, never will again. I even left it up to my son, if he wants to get baptized in a religion.21
 
 
 
 
Donald is a Loser!@DonaldkeepsLosingLOL·1dReplying to @ChallengerGirl2011, @DonaldkeepsLosingLOL, and 1 moreI knew I’d bounce at about 10. I started asking questions they couldn’t answer. I left about 20 years ago. When my wife and I got out the service she wanted us to go. I was just watching football in church then was like this is pointless. Walked out and never went back.11
 
 
 
 
ChallengerGirl2011@ChallengerGirl2011·1dReplying to @DonaldkeepsLosingLOL and @Huskergal64I may have been young, but I paid attention. I should have said something to my Mom, but I didnt want to burst her bubble. After she passed away, I went to church one more time, for my Nanas funeral and that was the last time, never again.1
 
 
 
 
Huskergal@Huskergal64·1dReplying to @ChallengerGirl2011WOW, your mom must suck What a terrible parent What kind of sick, depraved parent doesn't listen to their child unless said child is a complusive liar and storyteller I grew up in the Catholic faith. I was never afraid to tell my mom anything, but my mom cared about me. I guess that's the difference1

Do you support America? They ALL got angry by that one simply yes or no question. I remember when the Dems wanted peace for America. That is no longer the case. Very sad.

TurfandSurf@TurfandSurf·2dReplying to @SChase4567 and @Lock_Drumpf_UpTrump falsified business records related to the hush money payments as part of committing a separate crime related to campaign finance reporting.  Under NY law that is a felony.  It will be further explained in the next few weeks.Pretty sure Clinton didn't do that.  Nor did he ask a State secretary of state to find 11,000 votes.  Nor did he tell the DOJ that he had turned over all classified documents after having reviewed them himself and specifically keeping/hiding them.718

Also this judge is turning a misdemeanor into a felony...he can't do that, he's only doing it because it's Trump.

He sacrificed everything to stand in the way for us, investigated and under constant Media slander for seven years. Today he faced one of the most crucial moments we can ever imagine, only because he’s working for us the people, but he handled it braver than anyone ever could do. It should have never happened in free County like America. It should be a warning shot, a eye opener for everyone. We can’t allow this to be our new normal!1441163

Jentee@Jentee·31mReplying to @tuckfrump696969, @BidenWonYouFools, and 4 moreThe SVB had already passed it's stress test. Biden destroyed the economy. The Fed raised the interest rates. And the bank management was more worried about "diversity" than doing their fckn job.The regulations that were rolled back (that were supported by BOTH parties) wouldn't have made a bit of difference. Go woke, go broke.Yes, the bank was bailed out, and they could have sold it had Biden allowed it.11

Jentee@Jentee·4mReplying to @tuckfrump696969, @BidenWonYouFools, and 4 moreTrump didn't destroy the economy!  Do you think if you spout lies they become true?  Woke is Marxism. Seeing everything through the lens of power dynamics. Marx saw the Bourgeois vs Proletariat, and the woke have added race to help further divide.It's goal is to destroy all of our institutions. That the state have power over children more than their parents. Equity, meaning equal outcome without equal merit or work.Seeing mankind as "souless animals". Morality is what they say it is.1

Zane Farnsworth@ZaneFarnsworth·1dReplying to @patriotofliberty777 and @ZaneFarnsworthOkay so let’s break those down.  First: neither Stormy Daniels, (or Trump, for that matter) denied that this encounter occurred, nor that either one considered it to be an “affair”.  Second: Stormy Daniels did owe Trump legal fees due to the defamatory nature of her remarks.  Third: (least importantly) The Washington Examiner isn’t a credible source for anything. Fourth: None of this proves that Trump didn’t pay to silence her, even if she’s in the wrong, which is the crux of #Bragg’s case.3

Zane Farnsworth@ZaneFarnsworth·23hReplying to @SeymourHiney, @patriotofliberty777, and 1 moreIt’s literally the very first thing she says lmao, starting at 0:52;“Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country.  I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans.  This not the outcome we wanted, or that we worked so hard for, and I’m sorry that we did not win this election.”31
 
 
 
 
Seymour Hiney@SeymourHiney·23hReplying to @ZaneFarnsworth, @patriotofliberty777, and 1 moreI still don’t see the word, “concede” or “concession “. Am I missing something?11
 
 
 
 
Zane Farnsworth@ZaneFarnsworth·23hReplying to @SeymourHiney, @patriotofliberty777, and 1 moreWhen there are two candidates, and one publicly acknowledges not winning the election, and also that their opponent had, that is a concession.  You don’t have to say the word “concession” or “concede” because the act of acknowledging it is the concession.  The speech is the concession.When you go to McDonalds to order food, you don’t have to say “I’m here to place an order.”  They know that’s why you’re there, and saying “I’ll have a large number 3 with Coke” is the order.1
 
 
 
 
Seymour Hiney@SeymourHiney·23hReplying to @ZaneFarnsworthActually, I prefer to hear the words, so I know for sure. Until then, she never conceded, unless you have something else to convince me. Secondly, when someone behind the counter at McDonald’s, asks, can I help you? I respond with, I would like to order or place an order. It’s not hard to do.11
 
 
 
 
Zane Farnsworth@ZaneFarnsworth·22hReplying to @SeymourHiney and @ZaneFarnsworthI’m really not trying to be snarky or rude, and I don’t think you’re wrong for wanting to hear them say it explicitly, but what she did was concede.  There’s objectively no question about that.2
 
 
 
 
Seymour Hiney@SeymourHiney·22hReplying to @ZaneFarnsworth and @SeymourHineyI understand your view, but words have meaning to me, so if you can’t say them, it means that you are objectively avoiding them.22
 
 
 
 
Zane Farnsworth@ZaneFarnsworth·22hReplying to @SeymourHiney and @ZaneFarnsworthShe didn’t avoid them.  She acknowledged that she lost.  That is, by definition, concession.2
 
 
 
 
Seymour Hiney@SeymourHiney·22hReplying to @ZaneFarnsworth and @SeymourHineyAcknowledging she lost, just means she was defeated. Conceding means she would not be contesting the results. However, she goes on all these talk shows, saying the election was stolen from her, by the Russians. Like I said, words have meaning. I’m not trying to be snarky or anything, but you might want to find a different dictionary.

Walking Among Braindead Dems@stiegov·20hReplying to @stop_your_crying, @DionW, and 4 more1. Documents a former President can legally take with him when he leaves office.2. Documents a former Vice President CAN’T legally take with him when he leaves office.It’s very simple.11
 
 
 
 
Stop_Crying@stop_your_crying·20hReplying to @stiegov1. False, even if he could, there’s no documentation of him doing so. 2. True.1
 
 
 
 
Walking Among Braindead Dems@stiegov·20hReplying to @stop_your_crying and @stiegovWrong again dummy,  the presidential records act allows former presidents to take and keep classified documents.

Stop_Crying@stop_your_crying·20hReplying to @stiegov and @stop_your_cryingYou may want to look up the presidential ￼records act before quoting it. Hahaha. Oh and FYI the former president has ZERO authority. He is just an average Joe like you and I4
 
 
 
 
Walking Among Braindead Dems@stiegov·20hReplying to @stop_your_crying and @stiegovSure thing.  How about you’re quote the specific text within the PRA that prohibits a president from maintaining classified documents after leaving office.Mind you, EVERY former president since this was enacted is counting on you.1
 
 
 
 
Stop_Crying@stop_your_crying·19hReplying to @stiegov and @stop_your_cryingHow about you show the documentation where he did it. There would be a paper trail showing what was done, because OBVIOUSLY other people would need to know. You know the bureaucrats in Washington. Also even if he did declassify the information that doesn’t entitle him to keep it. That is the other argument. He didn’t own everything. The American people do. He is like a spoiled toddler when you take them to a toy store. He just tries to claim everything.1
 
 
 
 
Walking Among Braindead Dems@stiegov·19hReplying to @stop_your_crying and @stiegovHe just tries to claim everything.

Areal@CrackerJack34·1dReplying to @Honestvender and @Lara45If this does as you say it means the system works as it should. No one is above the law. And if Nixon hadn’t stepped down and Ford hadn’t pardoned him. Nixon may have been the first indicted president. Note I’m not overjoyed that trump is indicted I’m happy that if he committed any wrong doing that he will be help accountable just as you or I. Because if not any President moving forward will make trump look like an a Choirboy.42

President Biden didn’t call state election and attempt to pressure them to find votes for him. That’s election interference. President didn’t attempt a coup, that resulted in injury,death, and destruction of government property, in attempt to overthrow a free and fair election.  President didn’t   obstruct the retrieval of taken classified government property.  What should President get indicte?3

adrnmrzc@adrnmrzc·18hReplying to @Vinnyboombatz, @allywoods78, and 7 moreLet's go over how the economy works. Corporations across the globe lost a shit ton of money because of COVID. But here is basic economics - supply and demand. Example, gas was low, no one was driving, prices go down to entice you to buy. Everyone starts driving, everything goes up and prices go up to make up for lost profit. So now this goes on across all type of businesses and verticals and heats up the economy - people spending - this in turn increases inflation - which again, is global.

Probably to make up for the money lost in oil barrels during COVID, but at this point, it's greed. So the wall was not the solution? Trump said it was almost all done and that was the key. Afghanistan could have gone better had Trump not decided the pull-out date and also release soldiers, but - it was a shit job. See? I can admit that. Inflation is global. I'm good.1

Iudit@iuditjamaleddine·20hReplying to @Trumpfanatic69420, @Czent, and 8 moreWhen your interests are not with We the People, and in the case of the 4 presidents, all of them took us to perpetual wars, from father Bush to son Bush, to Clinton and Obama. In my humble opinion that was not in the interest of We the People. We did not get anything out of wars except for loss of human beings and destruction on both sides.  If that is considered being a looser, fine. None of them campaigned on idea of wars.  Now turn to President Trump.  He kept the promises made and no wars.23

A lot of presidents engaged in warfare - sometimes inappropriately (Bush) and yes I agree war should be avoided to the greatest extent possible (through diplomacy.)  The preamble includes the term “provide for the common defense.”  That could include stopping Germany from invading Britain, that could mean establishing a base in Djibouti, that could mean providing aid to Ukraine.  Trump did not start any wars but do not claim he kept his promises.11

Iudit@iuditjamaleddine·17hReplying to @ncscott63, @Czent, and 9 moreWhen I mentioned the four Presidents , I said democrats and republicans (rino).  The republicans in name only are just as bad as the democrats.  Remember this situation that we are in now is not between R or D, it’s between good and evil.  You just have to follow what each party supports and you get your response of who is who.  I choose to be on the side of God, I know what He expects of me.  He never changes, so it’s easy to follow Him.  I am never confused of what He expects.

Nancy@ncscott63·17hReplying to @glitchyconstruct, @Czent, and 10 moreBe honest for once in your miserable life.  You know good and well that Bush 1 and Bush 2 started wars in the Middle East.  Bush 2 wasn’t even honest about why we were going to war.  He said Iraq had “weapons of mass destruction.”  No weapons were found.  It would be laughable if military members hadn’t died.  The war was handed to Obama.  Obama handed it to Trump.  Biden kept his promise and ended that 20 year war.  It wasn’t pretty, but neither was the fall of Saigon!25
 
 
 
 
Glitchin@glitchyconstruct·17hReplying to @ncscott63, @Czent, and 10 moreBiden kept his promise… He also gave 85 billion worth of OUR equipment to them which they are openly selling to our enemies!

Tucker Hannity@sillysue61·13hReplying to @ncscott63They should just move there and they'll end up in his army. I don't know what Putin was thinking but what a complete Moron. I have a feeling he was thinking, "I have the U.S. President in my pocket therefore, I'm going to rule the world" Had Donnie won,he would not have avoided World War 3 in fact it would have just been the end of the world. Putin went in because he thought Pres. Biden would be weak. SURPRISE!  He's the second loser in the world because Donnie is the 1st!12

Trumpfanatic69420@Trumpfanatic69420·14hReplying to @ncscott63, @Czent, and 9 moreI agree with your sentiment, I do not think Obama nor Biden have contributed greatly to the war in iraq or Afghanistan.  But it is important to point out that both were illegal and both harmed American interests, and diminished faith in the us government.  That being said - trump also authorized troops in Iraq, Trump also executed drone strikes.  It is not an area where one can attack another politically because all parties are guilt of engaging.
 
 
 
 
Trumpfanatic69420@Trumpfanatic69420·14hReplying to @glitchyconstruct, @Czent, and 9 moreThis is true, the foreign policy of bush and Obama were not too dissimilar - both likely committed war crimes.  This is not something I take lightly.  The drone strikes under Obama were not acceptable, and I can only foresee that precedent to continue into the future.  Both trump and Biden have done the same and both have likely contributed to the negative perception of the United States worldwide as a result.

China has the benefit of being a powerful global power - like the US - and will likely escape any meaningful sanctions.  China is likely to continue its persecution of the Uyghurs and will not see any action to curtail this.  Uyghurs are neither white nor a protected group of people.

He is a totally biased Thug who should be let loose on the Biden Documents hidden in Chinatown, and the 1,850 BOXES secretly stored in Delaware, which Biden REFUSES to give up.

Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Mar 24Alan Dershowitz has written a new Book exposing the Radical Left’s never-ending quest to “Get Trump” which, in reality, is to Get and Destroy our Country. Alan enjoys saying, “I didn’t vote for Trump.” I believe he probably did, just uses that phrase for added credibility, but it doesn’t matter. He’s a brilliant guy who wrote a very important and special Book. It’s called, “GET TRUMP.” Alan loves our Country, and has fought long and hard for its betterment and, in many ways, for its survival.Donald J.

Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Mar 22Wow, look what was just found—A Letter from Cohen’s Lawyer to the Federal Election Commission.

Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Mar 22Now that Ron DeSanctimonious is finally admitting he’s in the Race by beginning to fight back, and now that his Polls have crashed so he has no other choice, let me explain the facts. He is, for a Republican, an average Governor, he got 1.2 million less Votes in Florida than me, he fought for massive cuts in Social Security and Medicare, and wanted Social Security minimum age to be raised to 70-years-old, or more. He is a disciple of Paul Ryan, and did whatever Ryan told him to do…2.46k8.31k28.5k
 
 
 
 
Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Mar 22…Florida has been successful for many years, long before I put Ron there—It’s amazing what Ocean & Sunshine will do! Surprise, Ron was a big Lockdown Governor on the China Virus, sealing all beaches and everything else for an extended period of time, was Third Worst in the Nation for COVID-19 Deaths (losing 86,294 People), Third Worst for Total # of Cases, at 7,516,906. Other Republican Governors did MUCH BETTER than Ron and, because I allowed them this “freedom,” never closed their States…9185.74k21.9k
 
 
 
 
Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Mar 22…Remember, I left that decision up to the Governors! For COVID Death Rates Per State, Ron, as Governor of Florida, did worse than New York. In Education, Florida ranks among the worst in the Country and on crime statistics, Florida ranked Third Worst in Murder, Third Worst in Rape, and Third Worst in Aggravated Assault. For 2022, Jacksonville was ranked as one of the Top 25 Major Crime Cities in the Country, with Tampa and Orlando not doing much better…7215.49k20k
 
 
 
 
Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Mar 22…On Education, Florida ranks #39 in Health & Safety in the Country, #50 in Affordability, and #30 in Education & Childcare, HARDLY GREATNESS THERE! The fact is, Ron is an average Governor, but the best by far in the Country in one category, Public Relations, where he easily ranks Number One—But it is all a Mirage, just look at the facts and figures, they don’t lie—And we don’t want Ron as our President!8415.49k20k

Length is important for Entertainment Value. LEAVE THE GOLF BALL ALONE. Balls will be mixed for years to come. What a mess.

In so doing Murdoch is saying that Fox behaved badly when, in fact, evidence has proven that the Election was rife with Election Fraud and Irregularities. Ryan is bad luck for Fox.

TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Feb 28There was so much Voter Fraud & Irregularities in the 2020 Presidential Election that it amazes me how weak and ineffective FoxNews is at portraying itself in the lawsuit against them. They look too scared and frightened to reveal the massive amounts of voter fraud & Irregularities already found, and it would actually help them in the lawsuit. Instead FoxNews wants to silence its anchors and reporters, the reason so many of their viewers fled. The Election was that of a Third World Country!1.49k5.91k20.8k
 
 
 
 
Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Feb 28Why is Rupert Murdoch throwing his anchors under the table, which also happens to be killing his case and infuriating his viewers, who will again be leaving in droves - they already are. There is MASSIVE evidence of voter fraud & irregularities in the 2020 Presidential Election. Just look at the documentary “2000 MULES” and you will see large scale ballot stuffing caught on government cameras, or votes cast without Legislatures approval, or just recently, the FBI/Twitter Files Scandal.

If he waited just ten days, the now “United Republican Congress” could have made it MUCH BETTER, or KILLED IT. Something is wrong with McConnell, and those Republican Senators that Vote with him. PRIMARY THEM ALL!!!Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Jan 7Thank you Kevin. It was my great honor!1.38k5.68k21.9k

Mayor, the “Peacefully and Patriotically” Speech, or the “recaptured” perfect tweets that the highly partisan and very crooked “Committee” wanted nobody to see. Gee, I wonder why?Donald J.

Donald J. Trump ReTruthedDonald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Nov 25, 2022Joe Biden said he is running for President, so why isn’t he appointing a Special Counsel to look into the criminal actions of him and his son, Hunter? There has never been anything like it in the history of our Country, and amazingly, it is perfectly documented for all to see. Maybe Trump Hater Jack Smith, who should never be allowed to work on anything having to do with me because of his and his family’s anger, hatred, and bias, should be looking into the Biden Crime Family instead?

Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Nov 27, 2022This sounds fair, doesn’t it? The “Justice” Department is CORRUPT.

TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Nov 19, 2022Hopefully the D.A. and Jury will see that the Trump family got no economic gain from the acts done by the executive in the historically never tried Fringe Benefits case in Manhattan.

Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Nov 18, 2022…Many people, perhaps most, don’t pay tax on the use of a company car or company apartment. Whether they know or not, that’s just the way it is. It’s called “standards and practices,” referring, I presume, to the standards and practices of large numbers of people within the Country. Out of fairness, it has a legal meaning. It should be a point in the Manhattan D.A. case. Did the former D.A. Pay tax on the use of his car? In the meantime, Violent Crime in New York has reached an ALL TIME HIGH!1.5k6.11k24.4k
 
 
 
 
Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Nov 18, 2022The D.A. case against two small Trump entities has fallen apart. Even the Media is saying so. There has never been a “Fringe Benefits” case such as this brought before. Did a long time executive pay tax on the use of a company car, or a company apartment, or payments (not even taken by us as a tax deduction!) for the education of his grandchildren? For this, he gets handcuffs and jail? The highly paid ￼accounting firm should have routinely picked these things up - we relied on them. VERY UNFAIR!8555.54k22.4k

Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Nov 10, 2022Incredible how dishonest the Fake News Media is.The Failing New York Times has gone crazy. So many of the people I Endorsed went on to victory on Tuesday Night, nobody was even close, and they literally make up a story refusing to write the facts, and only quoting enemies and losers. Almost all of the people I endorsed WON, yet if you read the story from two Trump hating writers (who only do as they are told!), you would not even recognize the truth.

Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Oct 31, 2022General Don Bolduc has run a great campaign to be the U.S. Senator from the beautiful State of New Hampshire. He was a strong and proud “Election Denier,” a big reason that he won the Nomination, but he then disavowed. He has since come back, at least on busing, but that is only a small part of N.H. Election Fraud. Nevertheless, Don Bolduc has asked for my Endorsement, and he’s got it, Complete & Total. His opponent is a disaster on Crime, the Border, Inflation, & all else.

Also, Drugs & Human Trafficking are OUT OF CONTROL. The good news is that Republican Nominee Mark Ronchetti is outstanding. He will be tough & smart on Crime, the Border & everything else.

Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Oct 19, 2022I once hosted Saturday Night Live, and the ratings were HUUUGE! Now, however, the ratings are lower than ever before, and the show will probably be put to “rest.” It is just not, at these levels, sustainable - A bad show that’s not funny or smart. L.M. is angry and exhausted, the show even more so. It was once good, never great, but now, like the Late Night Losers who have lost their audience but have no idea why, it is over for SNL - A great thing for America!1.31k5.13k26.3k
 
 
 
 
Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Oct 18, 2022Late Night Television is absolutely dying. The hosts are not funny, talented, or smart. Actually, it’s amazing that they keep their jobs. Ratings have gone south to a level never seen before. I could take the average person on the street, insert them in these loser's place, and the entertainment level would be better. Stephen Colbert is drawing “flies,” Jimmy Kimmel is down almost 50%, and Fallon has lost 60%. Basket case Seth Meyers has lost most of his audience, BORING.

Donald J. Trump ReTruthedMark LevinVerified Account@marklevinshow·Aug 13, 2022This is crap. The 1917 Espionage Act cannot apply to a President.  Under Article II, first sentence of Section I, he is the executive branch.  He is free to do as he wishes with these documents, including deciding as president to remove them as he leaves office. I suspect former presidents have done so. Unless and until a subpoena is issued to search Obama’s various estates, we won’t know.

Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Sep 30, 2022Congratulations to Ginni Thomas for having the courage of her convictions. Most importantly, she is right. The Election was Rigged and Stolen, and everyone knows it—especially the Radical Left Democrats who are destroying our Country. Cheating on Elections is the only thing they do really well, and that’s because Weak Republicans and RINOs allow them to get away with it. Fortunately, Ginni Thomas is not one of them and, by the way, her husband is Great!Donald J.

Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Sep 30, 2022Trevor Noah was a waste of time, no talent, no anything. Jon Stewart was only slightly better, but highly overrated. Comedy Central should focus on comedy and not politics, because they’re not very good at it. If these characters ever went neutral or Conservative, they’d double and triple up the ratings—but nobody’s figured that out except me!

Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Sep 2, 2022Bill Barr had “no guts,” and got “no glory.” He was a weak and pathetic RINO, who was so afraid of being Impeached that he became a captive to the Radical Left Democrats - “Please, please, please don’t impeach me,” he supposedly said. Barr never fought the way he should have for Election Integrity, and so much else. He started off OK as A.G., but faded fast - Didn’t have courage or stamina.

Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Sep 2, 2022Former A.G. Bill Barr was fired long before I left the White House on January 20th. He acted very slowly on the “No Collusion” Mueller Report in that the FBI and “Justice” had the “Laptop from Hell” in their possession, which totally exonerated me long before Mueller’s decision came out, years later - A waste of time & money. The Laptop information should have been released BEFORE the Rigged Election, not after it, for the VOTERS TO SEE.

Maher is a loser, and MAGA gets it - but Fox doesn’t. He said I was fortunate to have my home broken into because it was good for my polls.

Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Jun 17, 2022The Forgotten Men & Women of our Country are now being forced to endure crooked, rigged, and badly tainted Elections, and Open Borders that allow millions & millions of people to “invade” our Country, totally unchecked, unvetted, and having no idea where they came from or who they are. In other words, our Country is going to HELL! Our Economy is crashing, Inflation is crushing, Crime is raging, we are living with people who we have never seen before, and we have NO Voice.

Donald J. TrumpVerified Account@realDonaldTrump·Jun 17, 2022Such LIES & MISREPRESENTATIONS by the Unselects, and absolutely nobody allowed to challenge what is being said. As an example, I never suggested to V.P. Pence to “overturn” the Election (although Thomas Jefferson “took” the Georgia votes), but that he send the votes back to the various Legislatures so that they could determine if the Irregularities and Fraud were as widespread and significant as they seemed. Time has proven voter fraud to be even more flagrant, the Election was Rigged & Stolen!2.41k12.3k35.1k
