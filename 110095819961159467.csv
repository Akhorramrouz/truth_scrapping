94,Mar 27,kozma,Mark Kay@kozma·Mar 27Replying to @realDonaldTrumpTo whomever reads replies for these posts - I have noticed more and more negative feedback about Trump when he speaks negatively about Desantis. It seems to hurt more than it helps. Trump can easily win on policy and record alone. Just my 2 cents - try and minimize the opposition criticism unless it’s absolutely necessary.1,110096021604893621
